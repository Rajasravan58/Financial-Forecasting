## Dataset details
   The dataset used in this project is synthetically generated but closely follows realistic financial growth patterns for a company over a 5-year period. It includes monthly financial metrics with progressive growth to mimic business scaling.
   The data is generated as follows:

   - 5 years of monthly data: January 2020 to December 2024

   - Revenue, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), and Operating Expenses are linearly increased month-over-month.

   - Net Income is computed as:

   - Net Income = Revenue - COGS - Operating Expenses

   - Forecast period: 24 months ahead (2025â€“2026)
